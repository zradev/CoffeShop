          <p>
            The order processing time might take up to 1- 3 business days*.
            Processing includes checking, packing, and sending your orders to
            the post-office. After all these procedures, the tracking number
            will be provided to you via email.

          <p>All customers are charged at the time of purchase.</p>
          <p>All payments are in USD.</p>
          <p>
            Paying in local currency means your home bank handles the currency
            conversion; they will convert the currency from USD to Local
            currency for you.

          <h3>SEPARATE SHIPMENTS</h3>
          <p>
            When you order multiple items at a time, they may be shipped
            separately so they get to you faster. Due to warehouse locations and
            product availability, items may be shipped in separate shipments.
            You may receive one item before the next. We do this so that you can
            get your items as fast as possible. In this case, you will be
            provided with two or more tracking numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Weâ€™re available 9:00am to 6:00pm Monday through Friday and we
            typically respond in 1 business days.{" "}
